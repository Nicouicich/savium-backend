## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
- **EXECUTE ONE TASK AT A TIME** - Never batch or skip tasks
- **USE TodoWrite TOOL** - Track every single testing step
- **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** - Create TESTS.md with all findings
- **FAIL FAST** - Stop and document any critical issues immediately

## TESTING ENVIRONMENT SETUP

## SEQUENTIAL TESTING PROTOCOL

### PHASE 1: INFRASTRUCTURE VERIFICATION
Create todo list with EXACTLY these tasks (mark in_progress one at a time):

1. **Verify API Server Status**
   ```bash
   curl -I [API_BASE_URL]/health
   ```
   SUCCESS: 200 OK response
   DOCUMENT: Response time, headers, server info

2. **Check Database Connectivity**
   ```bash
   curl [API_BASE_URL]/api/status/db
   ```
   SUCCESS: Connection established
   DOCUMENT: Latency, connection pool status

3. **Validate Environment Variables**
   - Check .env configuration
   - Verify all required vars present
   - Test environment switching (dev/staging/prod)
   DOCUMENT: Missing or misconfigured variables

### PHASE 2: AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION TESTING

4. **Test User Registration**
   ```json
   POST /api/auth/register
   {
     "email": "test@example.com",

     "name": "Test User"
   }
   ```

   # Update
   curl -X PUT [endpoint]/[id] -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" -d [data]
   
   # Delete
   curl -X DELETE [endpoint]/[id] -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]"
   ```

2. **ALWAYS** wait for each test to complete before moving to next
3. **DOCUMENT** every single finding, no matter how minor
4. **STOP** testing if critical security vulnerability found
5. **USE** actual commands and tools, not simulations
6. **VERIFY** each test result before proceeding
7. **UPDATE** todo list status in real-time

Remember: You are the last line of defense before production. Every bug you find saves the company money and reputation.
